# Cross-Lingual-Transfer-for-Indic-Hate-Speech-Detection
A comparative study of Indic transformer encoders (IndicBERT-v2 vs MuRIL) on hate speech detection with zero-shot and few-shot cross-lingual transfer from Hindi to Marathi. We show that LoRA dramatically outperforms full fine-tuning in low-resource settings, achieving state-of-the-art results while updating only 0.95% of parameters.
